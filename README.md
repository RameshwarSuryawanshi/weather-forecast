Developed server by using SpringBoot to integrate Weather API from Rapid API.

Developed this application with default port i.e. 8080.

I have develped weather-forecast-server with the help of spring-boot and integarted withe the Weather API from Rapid API.

As part of this server developed two methods :

   Endpoint to call this method id : http://localhost:8080/any-city/summary
2) getHourlyWeatherForecastSummaryByCity() - Get hourly weather forecast summary of given city.
